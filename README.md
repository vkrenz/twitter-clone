# Twitter Clone App üê¶

Welcome to my **Twitter Clone**, a social media application built for iOS, inspired by the core features of Twitter. This project was developed using **Xcode**, **Firebase** for backend services, and **Swift** for the frontend. The goal was to replicate essential functionalities such as real-time posting, user authentication, and interaction features like comments, likes, and following.

## Features üöÄ

- **User Authentication**: Seamless sign-up and login flow using Firebase Authentication (Email/Password, Google).
- **Real-Time Tweeting**: Post tweets, view them instantly with Firebase Firestore integration.
- **Like & Comment**: Users can interact with tweets by liking and commenting in real-time.
- **Follow System**: Follow/unfollow users and view posts from the accounts you follow.
- **Media Support**: Upload images along with tweets.
- **Push Notifications**: Get notified for new likes, comments, and followers.
- **Responsive UI**: A clean, user-friendly interface designed to resemble Twitter, fully optimized for various iOS devices.

## Tools & Technologies üõ†Ô∏è

- **Swift**: The core language for iOS development.
- **Xcode**: The IDE used for building and debugging the app.
- **Firebase**: For backend services, including:
  - **Firebase Authentication**: Secure user login and sign-up.
  - **Firestore Database**: Real-time NoSQL database for handling tweets, likes, and comments.
